my functions should be applied to buttons for functionality.
-save function should save text inside text area and add to the list of mynotes section like note 3,4..this fucntion would require a for loop to automatic increment.
-if user doesnt want to save,cancel button clears text area
-new note button should give access to write on text area
-dark theme button should take a function to apply colors to dark css
-my notes section may or may not be available to fetch saved notes.
